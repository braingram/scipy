    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The array for which to compute the marginal sums.

    margsums : list of ndarrays
        A list of length `a.ndim`.  `margsums[k]` is the result
        of summing `a` over all axes except `k`; it has the same

    Compute the expected frequencies from a contingency table.

    Given an n-dimensional contingency table of observed frequencies,
    compute the expected frequencies for the table based on the marginal
    sums under the assumption that the groups associated with each
    dimension are independent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    observed : array_like
        The table of observed frequencies.  (While this function can handle
        a 1-D array, that case is trivial.  Generally `observed` is at
        least 2-D.)

    Returns
    -------
    expected : ndarray of float64
        The expected frequencies, based on the marginal sums of the table.
        Same shape as `observed`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.stats.contingency import expected_freq
    >>> observed = np.array([[10, 10, 20],[20, 20, 20]])

def chi2_contingency(observed, correction=True, lambda_=None):
    """Chi-square test of independence of variables in a contingency table.

    This function computes the chi-square statistic and p-value for the
    hypothesis test of independence of the observed frequencies in the
    contingency table [1]_ `observed`.  The expected frequencies are computed
    based on the marginal sums under the assumption of independence; see
    `scipy.stats.contingency.expected_freq`.  The number of degrees of
    freedom is (expressed using numpy functions and attributes)::

        dof = observed.size - sum(observed.shape) + observed.ndim - 1


    Parameters
    ----------
    observed : array_like
        The contingency table. The table contains the observed frequencies
        (i.e. number of occurrences) in each category.  In the two-dimensional
        case, the table is often described as an "R x C table".
    correction : bool, optional
        If True, *and* the degrees of freedom is 1, apply Yates' correction
        for continuity.  The effect of the correction is to adjust each
        observed value by 0.5 towards the corresponding expected value.
    lambda_ : float or str, optional
        By default, the statistic computed in this test is Pearson's
        chi-squared statistic [2]_.  `lambda_` allows a statistic from the
        Cressie-Read power divergence family [3]_ to be used instead.  See
        `power_divergence` for details.

    Returns
    -------
    chi2 : float
        The test statistic.
    p : float
        The p-value of the test
    dof : int
        Degrees of freedom
    expected : ndarray, same shape as `observed`
        The expected frequencies, based on the marginal sums of the table.

    See Also
    --------
    contingency.expected_freq
    fisher_exact
    chisquare
    power_divergence
    barnard_exact

    Notes
    -----
    An often quoted guideline for the validity of this calculation is that
    the test should be used only if the observed and expected frequencies
    in each cell are at least 5.

    This is a test for the independence of different categories of a
    population. The test is only meaningful when the dimension of
    `observed` is two or more.  Applying the test to a one-dimensional
    table will always result in `expected` equal to `observed` and a
    chi-square statistic equal to 0.

    This function does not handle masked arrays, because the calculation
    does not make sense with missing values.

    Like stats.chisquare, this function computes a chi-square statistic;
    the convenience this function provides is to figure out the expected
    frequencies and degrees of freedom from the given contingency table.
    If these were already known, and if the Yates' correction was not
    required, one could use stats.chisquare.  That is, if one calls::

        chi2, p, dof, ex = chi2_contingency(obs, correction=False)

    then the following is true::

        (chi2, p) == stats.chisquare(obs.ravel(), f_exp=ex.ravel(),
                                     ddof=obs.size - 1 - dof)

    The `lambda_` argument was added in version 0.13.0 of scipy.

    ----------

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float
        Value of the test statistic

    Notes
    -----
    Cramer's V, Tschuprow's T and Pearson's Contingency Coefficient, all
    measure the degree to which two nominal or ordinal variables are related,
    or the level of their association. This differs from correlation, although
    many often mistakenly consider them equivalent. Correlation measures in
    what way two variables are related, whereas, association measures how
    related the variables are. As such, association does not subsume
    independent variables, and is rather a test of independence. A value of
    1.0 indicates perfect association, and 0.0 means the variables have no
    association.

    Both the Cramer's V and Tschuprow's T are extensions of the phi
    coefficient.  Moreover, due to the close relationship between the
    Cramer's V and Tschuprow's T the returned values can often be similar
    or even equivalent.  They are likely to diverge more as the array shape
    diverges from a 2x2.
